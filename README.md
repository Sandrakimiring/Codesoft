# CODSOFT Data Science Internship Projects

This repository contains the projects I completed as part of my Data Science internship with CODSOFT. The internship provided an excellent opportunity to enhance my skills in machine learning, data preprocessing, and model evaluation. Each project explores different areas of data science, from classification and regression tasks to sales prediction.

## Projects
1. [Titanic Survival Prediction](https://github.com/Sandrakimiring/Titanic-survival-prediction) - A model that predicts whether a passenger survived or not based on various features like age, gender, and class.
2. [Movie Rating Prediction](https://github.com/Sandrakimiring/movie-rating-prediction) - A model that predicts the rating of a movie based on features such as genre, director, and actors.
3. [Sales Prediction](https://github.com/Sandrakimiring/SALES-PREDICTION) - A sales prediction model that forecasts product sales based on advertising spend, audience segmentation, and more.

Each project folder contains the code, datasets, and models used for training and evaluation.
